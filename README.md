# ðŸ§  Question Clustering for Symmetric Semantic Search

This project explores the task of clustering semantically similar **natural language questions** to optimize **symmetric question-to-question search**. The goal is to speed up search and reduce computation while maintaining high retrieval quality.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

Symmetric search (e.g., "Which question is similar to mine?") is useful in:
- FAQ systems
- Customer support bots
- Educational platforms
- Duplicate detection (e.g., Stack Overflow)

However, pairwise comparison over all questions is computationally expensive.

## ðŸš€ Solution Overview

I propose a clustering-based retrieval system:

1. **Semantic Encoding**  
   Use pretrained transformers (`e5-base`, `BGE`, `RuBERT`) to encode questions.

2. **Clustering**  
   Cluster questions using **DBSCAN** or **OPTICS** to group similar ones.

3. **Cluster Representatives**  
   Select a central question for each cluster as its representative.

4. **Fast Search**  
   For a new query:
   - Find the nearest **cluster center**
   - Search only **within that cluster** â€” reducing computations up to **10â€“50Ã—**

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

I evaluate the performance of the clustered retrieval system compared to traditional symmetric search using the following metrics:

| **Metric**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cosine_similarity`   | Measures semantic closeness between the query and retrieved questions          |
| `score_diff`          | Difference in similarity between full pairwise search and clustered search     |
| `Recall@k`            | (Optional) Checks if the full-search top-k results contain the clustered result |
| `Execution Time`      | Average time taken per query for full vs. clustered retrieval                  |

**Highlights:**
- ðŸ“Š Average `score_diff` between full vs clustered search: **â‰ˆ 0.07**
- âš¡ Speedup: **10Ã— to 50Ã— faster** retrieval using clusters
- ðŸ§  Semantic quality is preserved despite reduced computations
